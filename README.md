🧪 Diabetes Progression Prediction using Linear Regression

This project uses the load_diabetes() dataset from Scikit-learn to build a Linear Regression model that predicts the progression of diabetes in patients based on medical information.

✅ Objective

To build a Linear Regression model that can predict diabetes progression using patient data such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and blood serum levels.


---

📦 Dataset: load_diabetes() (from sklearn.datasets)

Total Samples: 442

Features: 10 medical attributes

Age

Sex

BMI

Blood Pressure

Serum Measurements (s1 to s6)


Target: A continuous value representing the disease progression score

⚙️ Model Used

Linear Regression

Predicts a continuous value for each patient indicating their expected level of diabetes progression.

🛠️ Steps

1. Load the diabetes dataset


2. Split it into training and testing sets


3. Train a Linear Regression model on the training data


4. Use the model to predict diabetes progression on the test data

🎯 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to use Linear Regression for medical prediction tasks, specifically for predicting the severity of diabetes progression based on patient input features.
