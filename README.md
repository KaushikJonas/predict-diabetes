üîç Symptoms of Diabetes
Diabetes symptoms may vary depending on the type and how high blood sugar levels are. Some people, especially those with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, may not experience symptoms at first.

Common Symptoms (Both Type 1 & Type 2):

Frequent urination (Polyuria)

High glucose levels cause the kidneys to excrete excess sugar through urine, leading to frequent urination.

Excessive thirst (Polydipsia)

Due to frequent urination, the body loses a lot of fluids, causing increased thirst.

Increased hunger (Polyphagia)

The body isn‚Äôt able to use glucose properly, leading to constant hunger even after eating.

Unexplained weight loss

Especially common in type 1 diabetes; the body breaks down muscle and fat for energy due to lack of insulin.

Fatigue

Cells don‚Äôt get enough glucose, making the person feel weak and tired.

Blurred vision

High blood sugar can pull fluid from the lenses of the eyes, affecting focus.

Slow healing of wounds or cuts

Poor blood flow and nerve damage can delay healing.

Tingling or numbness in hands or feet

Caused by nerve damage (diabetic neuropathy), especially in long-term uncontrolled diabetes.

Frequent infections

Such as gum infections, skin infections, or vaginal infections due to weakened immune response.

‚ö†Ô∏è Causes of Diabetes

Causes of Type 1 Diabetes:

Autoimmune Reaction:

The body‚Äôs immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.

Genetics:

A family history of type 1 diabetes increases the risk.

Environmental Triggers:

Viral infections (e.g., Coxsackie virus) may trigger the autoimmune response.

No Lifestyle Link:

Type 1 diabetes is not caused by lifestyle or diet.

Causes of Type 2 Diabetes:
Insulin Resistance:

Body cells become resistant to insulin and can't absorb glucose effectively.

Obesity:

Excess fat, especially around the abdomen, increases insulin resistance.

Sedentary Lifestyle:

Lack of physical activity contributes to weight gain and insulin resistance.

Poor Diet:

Diets high in sugar, processed foods, and unhealthy fats increase the risk.

Genetics & Family History:

A strong hereditary component exists in type 2 diabetes.

Age:

Risk increases with age, especially after 45.

Other Health Conditions:

High blood pressure, cholesterol, and PCOS can increase risk.

Causes of Gestational Diabetes (during pregnancy):
Hormonal Changes:

Pregnancy hormones can interfere with insulin‚Äôs effectiveness.

Overweight During Pregnancy:

Excess weight increases insulin resistance.

Family or Personal History:

Having a history of gestational diabetes or a family history of type 2 diabetes increases risk.
